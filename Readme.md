# Project Title

InstantBank

## Introduction

This is a small bank app application.

## Features

- Feature 1: Transfer Money.

- Feature 2: Request Loan.

- Feature 3: Close Account.

- Feature 4: Two 2 different accounts.

## Installation

There is no upload, because this is a project to enhance my basic skills.

## Usage

There are 2 different accounts, namely 'John Parker' and 'Jessica Davis'. It is not necessary to write all the names; writing only the initials is sufficient. For John Parker, you need to write "jp" for the password 1111 and click the button. For Jessica Davis, it is "jd" for the password 2222.
There are two currencies, Euro and Dollar. Euro is for John, while Dollar is for Jessica. You can transfer money, borrow, and close the account, provided you do not exceed the amount in your account. You can switch to another account to view the transactions you have made and see the money you have sent or borrowed. Additionally, you will see that the account you closed cannot be reopened, which indicates that the procedure has been followed correctly. However, do not rush. You can refresh the page to restart the transactions. Remember, you have 2 minutes to remain active in the account at the bottom right corner.
